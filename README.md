# Depth Estimation based on Attention Gate

This is a depth estimation project based on the Attention Gate mechanism, aimed at achieving accurate depth estimation through Stereo Vision techniques. The project is implemented using Python and deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch).

## Features
- Enhances depth estimation accuracy using the Attention Gate mechanism.
- Supports stereo image pairs as input.
- Provides pre-trained models (optional, if available).
- Suitable for computer vision research and applications.
